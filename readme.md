This project is discontinued, mainly because PSP1000 joystick only supports 4-direction movements. I didn't do my homework enough ðŸ˜­
If changed into another key or other joysticks, things should work.

Also, ordering this kind of designs from JLCPCB or PCBway won't save one money. They claim designs with < 1/3 width/height board connections as different designs, so mine got claimed as 3 seperate designs ðŸ™„
